ReMarkable [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/danielsreichenbach/ReMarkable.png)](https://travis-ci.org/danielsreichenbach/ReMarkable)
==========
ReMarkable is a Markdown-like syntax and PHP script for writing website
articles in plain text.

*This* version has been updated and stripped from the original [ReMarkable][1]
library by [Kroc Camen][2].  It has been updated to comply with PHP [PSR-0][21],
[PSR-1][22], and [PSR-2][23].

Support for testing the library with [Composer][31], and [Travis-CI][33] has
also been added, which means you can install the library via [Packagist][32].
